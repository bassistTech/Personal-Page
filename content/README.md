[My design for a 12 inch bass speaker](12-in-bass-speaker)

A number of years ago I designed
a lightweight speaker for bass. It uses an Eminence Delta-Lite 2512-ii driver, in a compact
ported box, and weighs about 17 pounds. It has been my preferred speaker for "loud" gigs
since then.

This is my latest writeup on how speakers work. I will continue to refine and update this
as I gain new knowledge, or if anybody finds a bug! It's not intended to be a design manual,
but explains where the equations come from, that are the basis for speaker modeling
programs.

This is my attempt at an online speaker "design" program. Don't use it for anything serious.
However, it provides a way of entering and sharing a design via a simple web link. It's
fully open source and based on the equations developed in my speaker theory writeup.

[JFET bass preamp](JFET-bass-preamp)

A complete preamp for bass instruments, with gain, bass, swept midrange, treble, and volume. The whole circuit
is based on six discrete transistors. I built one of these by hand for fun, but have not decided to
commercialize it -- yet!

[4th order active JFET filter](4th-order-active-JFET-filter)

A 4th order audio high pass filter with one swept section, based on a pair of discrete JFETs. This is the
first thing I hooked up when I was investigating what became HPF-Pre Series 3.
