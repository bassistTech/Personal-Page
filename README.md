<h3><a name="music"></a>Music</h3>

<p>Thanks for visiting my page. If you are looking for a
versatile upright or electric bassist you have come to the right
place! My experience includes more than a decade of freelance
jazz gigs, symphonic and chamber groups, pit orchestras, ethnic
dance bands, and so forth. I offer a complete range of skills,
including fluent sight-reading, improvisation, knowledge of the
standard jazz repertoire, and simply being easy to deal with.</p>

<p>I moved to Madison in 1997, and have played with numerous
local groups, on a regular or substitute basis.</p>

<p>By day, I am a principal optical systems engineer at the
Madison outpost of Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp., the world
leader in serving science. It's a great place to work, in a
wonderful town. I have a PhD in physics and extensive experience
in development of optical and electronic instrumentation systems.</p>

<h3><a name="projects"></a>Electronics and Speakers</h3>

<p>Related to music, I have a bit of an electronics hobby. As I
accumulate results, if they are interesting, then I write them up
to share. Often, I find that writing a brief report helps me
critique my own ideas, and also attracts helpful comments that
improve my knowledge. What follows are some of my recent
projects.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker Theory</strong>: What started out as a simple
project to build a bass speaker turned into a quest to understand
the physics of how speakers work. I have written up some of my
notes to share with others who might be interested:</p>

<p><b>Speaker Design Programs</b>: Once I figured out the speaker
analysis equations, I decided to test my knowledge by writing an
analysis program that should produce results similar to widely
available software. Then I got the idea that I could use
multi-platform open source tools to provide a design program that
can run on MacOS as well as Linux and Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Preamp Electronics</strong>: This is a collection of
preamp design ideas, ranging from real and tested, to
hypothetical.</p>

<p><strong>Gear Review</strong>: Right now, there is nothing like
<em>Consumer Reports</em> for bass gear. There are lots of
&quot;reviews&quot; consisting primarly of subjective listening
and playing experiences, but practically no information on the
technical merits of products. I decided to take an unabashedly
entry-level product and analyze its performance.</p>
