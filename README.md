## Music
Thanks for visiting my page. If you are looking for a
versatile upright or electric bassist you have come to the right
place! My experience includes more than a decade of freelance
jazz gigs, symphonic and chamber groups, pit orchestras, ethnic
dance bands, and so forth. I offer a complete range of skills,
including fluent sight-reading, improvisation, knowledge of the
standard jazz repertoire, and simply being easy to deal with.

I moved to Madison in 1997, and have played with numerous
local groups, on a regular or substitute basis.

By day, I am a principal optical systems engineer at the
Madison outpost of Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp., the world
leader in serving science. It's a great place to work, in a
wonderful town. I have a PhD in physics and extensive experience
in development of optical and electronic instrumentation systems.

## Electronics and Speakers

<h3><a name="projects"></a>Electronics and Speakers</h3>

Related to music, I have a bit of an electronics hobby. As I
accumulate results, if they are interesting, then I write them up
to share. Often, I find that writing a brief report helps me
critique my own ideas, and also attracts helpful comments that
improve my knowledge. What follows are some of my recent
projects.

### Speaker Theory

What started out as a simple
project to build a bass speaker turned into a quest to understand
the physics of how speakers work. I have written up some of my
notes to share with others who might be interested:
